## 📌Overview:
I created an interactive sales dashboard in Excel as part of a self-learning project to analyze 2022 sales data for a fictional e-commerce brand. This project helped me explore sales trends by gender, age, region, and channels—enhancing my skills in data cleaning, pivot tables, and visualization.

## 🎯Goal and 🚧Challenges:
The goal was to explore sales trends across gender, age groups, order status, sales channels, and regions.
Key challenges I tackled included:
- Cleaning inconsistent and unstructured raw data
- Segmenting complex datasets
- Creating insights under realistic time constraints

## 🛠Tools Used:
- Excel (Data Cleaning & Formatting, Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, KPI Metrics) 

## 🔧What I Did:
- Cleaned and organized the dataset for accurate analysis
- Built pivot tables and dynamic summaries in Excel
- Designed interactive charts (bar, pie, and conditional formatting) for visualization
- Delivered a full sales breakdown by key segments

## 💡Impact:
- Gained practical experience simulating real-world data projects
- Strengthened skills in Excel, data storytelling, and dashboard creation
- Created a user-friendly report that supports data-driven decisions

This self-initiated project helped me build confidence and apply my skills in a practical, business-focused way.
